# FSCppRaytracer

A simple Cpp Raytracer from scratch: uses Monte Carlo integration to render images out of .obj files.

Keep in mind that this is sort of a prototype / learning project (although it runs decently fast). Lots of experimentations were done, and the code definitely needs some refactoring.
For a more usable (and (hopefully) much faster) version of this project, see my OpenCL Raytracer repo (https://github.com/QuentinHuan/ENSEM3A_OpenCLRaytracer)
